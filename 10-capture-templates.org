Brilliant ideas strike at inconvenient times. You're mid-conversation, mid-code, mid-commute. You need to capture the thought NOW—before it evaporates—without derailing your current focus.

Enter Org-Mode's capture system: instant note-taking from anywhere, filed automatically to the right place, with zero friction.

* The Basic Capture Workflow

Bind a global capture key (add to your config):

#+begin_src elisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c c") 'org-capture)
#+end_src

Now from anywhere in Emacs:

1. =C-c c= - Opens capture menu
2. Choose template (we'll define these)
3. Type note
4. =C-c C-c= - Save and return to what you were doing

The note files automatically to your inbox. You barely broke focus.

* Your First Capture Template

Add to config:

#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-capture-templates
      '(("t" "TODO" entry (file+headline "~/org/inbox.org" "Tasks")
         "* TODO %?\n  %i\n  %a")))
#+end_src

Let's decode:

- ="t"= - The key to trigger this template
- ="TODO"= - Description shown in capture menu
- =entry= - Create a new heading
- =(file+headline "~/org/inbox.org" "Tasks")= - File location and heading
- ="* TODO %?\n  %i\n  %a"= - The template text

The =%= symbols are placeholders:

- =%?= - Cursor position after template expands
- =%i= - Initial region content (if you selected text before capturing)
- =%a= - Link to where you were when you captured

Press =C-c c t=, type your task, press =C-c C-c=. Boom. Captured.

* Template Placeholders: The Full Arsenal

** Position and Content

- =%?= - Cursor position
- =%i= - Initial content (selected region)
- =%a= - Link to current location
- =%A= - Like =%a=, but only if called from agenda

** Timestamps

- =%t= - Timestamp (date only)
- =%T= - Timestamp (date and time)
- =%u= - Inactive timestamp (date only)
- =%U= - Inactive timestamp (date and time)
- =%^t= - Prompt for date
- =%^T= - Prompt for date and time

** Context

- =%f= - Current file name
- =%F= - Current file name (full path)
- =%n= - Your user name
- =%c= - Kill ring head (clipboard content)
- =%x= - X clipboard content

** Prompts

- =%^{Prompt}= - Prompt for text
- =%^{Prompt|default|choice1|choice2}= - Prompt with completion
- =%^g= - Prompt for tags
- =%^G= - Prompt for tags (with allowed tags completion)

** Special

- =%l= - Link to current location (like =%a= but no description)
- =%(elisp expression)= - Evaluate elisp, insert result

* Practical Capture Templates

** Quick Task

#+begin_src elisp
("t" "Task" entry (file+headline "~/org/inbox.org" "Tasks")
 "* TODO %?\n  %U\n  %a")
#+end_src

Creates:
#+begin_example
* TODO Fix the bug I just noticed
  [2025-01-15 Wed 14:23]
  [[file:code.py::42][code.py:42]]
#+end_example

** Meeting Notes

#+begin_src elisp
("m" "Meeting" entry (file+datetree "~/org/meetings.org")
 "* %^{Meeting Title}\n  %U\n  Attendees: %^{Attendees}\n\n  %?")
#+end_src

Prompts for title and attendees, files by date:

#+begin_example
* 2025
** 2025-01 January
*** 2025-01-15 Wednesday
**** Client kickoff meeting
     [2025-01-15 Wed 14:23]
     Attendees: Alice, Bob, Carol

     [Your notes here]
#+end_example

** Journal Entry

#+begin_src elisp
("j" "Journal" entry (file+datetree "~/org/journal.org")
 "* %U\n  %?")
#+end_src

Simple dated entry. Daily journaling made effortless.

** Idea Capture

#+begin_src elisp
("i" "Idea" entry (file "~/org/ideas.org")
 "* %^{Idea Title}\n  %U\n  %?")
#+end_src

Prompts for title, adds timestamp, positions cursor for details.

** Link Repository

#+begin_src elisp
("l" "Link" entry (file+headline "~/org/links.org" "Links")
 "* %a\n  %U\n  %?")
#+end_src

Capturing a web article? Link auto-captured with timestamp and space for notes.

** Code TODO

#+begin_src elisp
("c" "Code TODO" entry (file+headline "~/org/code-todos.org" "Code Tasks")
 "* TODO %?\n  %a\n  %i")
#+end_src

Browsing code, spot something that needs work? Capture it with link to exact location and selected code snippet.

** Email Follow-up

#+begin_src elisp
("e" "Email" entry (file+headline "~/org/inbox.org" "Emails")
 "* TODO Reply to %:from about %:subject\n  %a\n  %U")
#+end_src

When using Emacs for email, =%:from= and =%:subject= pull email metadata. Instant email TODO with link back to message.

* Advanced Target Locations

** File+Headline

#+begin_src elisp
(file+headline "~/org/projects.org" "Project Alpha")
#+end_src

Captures under specific heading.

** File+Olp (Outline Path)

#+end_src

Captures under =Work > Project Alpha > Tasks= hierarchy.

** File+Datetree

#+begin_src elisp
(file+datetree "~/org/journal.org")
#+end_src

Files by date hierarchy (year > month > day).

** File+Function

#+begin_src elisp
(file+function "~/org/inbox.org" my-custom-function)
#+end_src

Custom function determines location. Ultimate flexibility.

** Clock

#+begin_src elisp
(clock)
#+end_src

Captures under currently clocked task. Perfect for adding notes while working.

** Current File

#+begin_src elisp
(file+headline buffer-file-name "Notes")
#+end_src

Captures in current file. Useful for project-specific captures.

* Template Types

** Entry (Heading)

#+begin_src elisp
entry (file "~/org/inbox.org")
"* TODO %?"
#+end_src

Creates a new heading.

** Item (List Item)

#+begin_src elisp
item (file+headline "~/org/shopping.org" "Groceries")
"- %?"
#+end_src

Creates a list item:
#+begin_example
* Groceries
  - Milk
  - Eggs
  - [Your new item]
#+end_example

** Checkitem (Checkbox)

#+begin_src elisp
checkitem (file+headline "~/org/packing.org" "Packing List")
"- [ ] %?"
#+end_src

Creates checkbox item.

** Table-line

#+begin_src elisp
table-line (file+headline "~/org/habits.org" "Exercise Log")
"| %U | %^{Exercise} | %^{Duration} |"
#+end_src

Adds row to table:

#+begin_example
* Exercise Log
  | Date              | Exercise | Duration |
  |-------------------+----------+----------|
  | [2025-01-15 Wed]  | Running  | 30 min   |
  | [Your new entry]  |          |          |
#+end_example

** Plain Text

#+begin_src elisp
plain (file+headline "~/org/notes.org" "Quick Notes")
"%?"
#+end_src

Inserts plain text (no heading, no list marker).

* Template Options

Customize template behavior:

#+begin_src elisp
("t" "Task" entry (file+headline "~/org/inbox.org" "Tasks")
 "* TODO %?\n  %U"
 :empty-lines 1        ; Add blank line after entry
 :clock-in t           ; Start clock when capturing
 :clock-resume t       ; Resume previous clock when done
 :immediate-finish t   ; Don't prompt for editing
 :jump-to-captured t   ; Jump to captured entry when done
 :kill-buffer t        ; Kill capture buffer when done
 :prepend t            ; Insert at beginning of target
 :unnarrowed t)        ; Show full file, not just target
#+end_src

Mix and match options for each template.

* Multi-Template Menus

Group related templates:

#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-capture-templates
      '(("w" "Work")
        ("wt" "Work Task" entry (file+headline "~/org/work.org" "Tasks")
         "* TODO %?")
        ("wm" "Work Meeting" entry (file+datetree "~/org/work.org")
         "* %^{Meeting} %U\n  %?")

        ("p" "Personal")
        ("pt" "Personal Task" entry (file+headline "~/org/personal.org" "Tasks")
         "* TODO %?")
        ("pj" "Journal" entry (file+datetree "~/org/journal.org")
         "* %U\n  %?")))
#+end_src

=C-c c w= shows work options, =C-c c p= shows personal options.

* Context-Aware Capture

Use elisp to make templates context-aware:

#+begin_src elisp
("t" "Task" entry
 (file+headline
  (lambda () (if (string-match "work" (or (buffer-file-name) ""))
                 "~/org/work.org"
               "~/org/personal.org"))
  "Tasks")
 "* TODO %?")
#+end_src

Capturing from work files? Goes to work.org. From personal files? Goes to personal.org.

* Capture Hooks

Run code before/after capture:

#+begin_src elisp
(add-hook 'org-capture-before-finalize-hook
          (lambda ()
            (save-excursion
              (org-back-to-heading)
              (org-set-tags ":captured:"))))
#+end_src

Auto-tag all captured items.

Or:

#+begin_src elisp
(add-hook 'org-capture-after-finalize-hook
          (lambda ()
            (shell-command "notify-send 'Org Capture' 'Item captured!'")))
#+end_src

Desktop notification on capture.

* Aborting Captures

Started capture but changed your mind?

- =C-c C-k= - Kill capture (nothing saved)
- =C-c C-w= - Refile instead (save but different location)

* Capture from Outside Emacs

Want to capture from your browser, terminal, or anywhere?

Install =org-protocol= and set up browser bookmarklet:

#+begin_src javascript
javascript:location.href='org-protocol://capture?template=l&url='+encodeURIComponent(location.href)+'&title='+encodeURIComponent(document.title)
#+end_src

Click bookmarklet → Emacs pops up → capture template → back to browser. Web to Org in seconds.

Or use =emacsclient=:

#+begin_src bash
#!/bin/bash
emacsclient -n "org-protocol://capture?template=t&body=$1"
#+end_src

Terminal to Org.

* Practical Capture Systems

** The GTD Inbox

#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-capture-templates
      '(("i" "Inbox" entry (file "~/org/inbox.org")
         "* %?\n  %U")))
#+end_src

Everything goes to inbox. Process later. Never lose a thought.

** The Cornell Note-taking System

#+begin_src elisp
("n" "Note" entry (file+datetree "~/org/notes.org")
 "* %^{Topic}\n  %U\n\n** Cues\n   %?\n\n** Notes\n\n** Summary\n")
#+end_src

Structured note template.

** The Zettelkasten

#+begin_src elisp
("z" "Zettel" entry (file "~/org/zettelkasten.org")
 "* %^{Title}\n  :PROPERTIES:\n  :ID: %(org-id-uuid)\n  :END:\n  %U\n\n  %?")
#+end_src

Each note gets unique ID for linking.

* Your Exercise

1. Set up basic capture templates (task, note, journal at minimum)
2. Bind =C-c c= globally to =org-capture=
3. Practice capturing from different contexts (agenda, code files, etc.)
4. Create at least one template with prompts (=%^{...}=)
5. Set up a datetree-based template
6. Try capturing with selected text (region)
7. Experiment with different template options (=:clock-in=, =:empty-lines=, etc.)

* The Philosophy of Capture

The best capture system is invisible. You have a thought, press two keys, type briefly, done. Back to work. No context switches, no app switching, no "where should this go?"

Org-Mode's capture templates remove friction from note-taking. Every thought can be preserved without disrupting flow.

The question isn't "should I capture this?" It's "why wouldn't I?"
