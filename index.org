/A comprehensive guide to mastering Org-Mode for personal knowledge management, task organization, and literate programming/

* About This Book

Welcome to "Org-Mode with Emacs"—your comprehensive guide to one of the most powerful text-based productivity systems ever created. Whether you're a developer looking for better project management, a researcher seeking reproducible workflows, or someone who just wants to organize their life in plain text that will last forever, this book is for you.

Org-Mode is deceptively simple at first glance: it's plain text with a bit of structure. But beneath that simplicity lies a complete ecosystem for managing tasks, tracking time, capturing ideas, executing code, and publishing beautiful documents—all without ever leaving your text editor.

* What You'll Learn

This book takes you from complete beginner to confident Org-Mode user, covering:

- *Document Structure*: Master outlines, lists, formatting, and the organizational principles that make Org-Mode powerful
- *Task Management*: Build custom TODO workflows that adapt to your methodology, not the other way around
- *Time Tracking*: Track where your hours go with frightening precision
- *Metadata*: Use tags and properties to transform static lists into queryable databases
- *Agenda Views*: Create dynamic, customizable dashboards of your entire task universe
- *Capture Templates*: Implement frictionless note-taking from anywhere
- *Literate Programming*: Write executable documents where code and documentation are one
- *Publishing*: Export to HTML, PDF, Markdown, and more from a single source

* Who This Book Is For

This book is written for:

- *Programmers* who want their notes to contain executable code
- *Researchers* seeking reproducible, publishable workflows
- *Writers* who value distraction-free writing with powerful organization
- *Project Managers* who need customizable task tracking
- *Knowledge Workers* building personal knowledge bases
- *GTD Practitioners* looking for a flexible implementation
- *Anyone* who's frustrated with proprietary productivity apps that lock in your data

* Prerequisites

You'll need:

- *Emacs* (22.1 or later, though newer is better)
- *Willingness to learn* keyboard-driven workflows
- *Patience* for the initial learning curve
- *Appreciation* for plain text and data longevity

No programming experience required, though code examples appear throughout. They're written to be understandable even if you've never coded before.

* Philosophy

This book embraces several principles:

*Plain Text Forever*: Your data should outlive any application. Plain text from 1970 is still readable. Can you say the same about proprietary formats?

*Composable Primitives*: Org-Mode provides building blocks. You compose them into systems that match your brain, not someone else's methodology.

*Power Through Simplicity*: The most powerful features often have the simplest syntax. An asterisk creates a heading. That heading can become a task, a project, a section, or anything you need.

*Progressive Disclosure*: Start simple. Add complexity only when needed. You don't need to master everything at once.

* How to Use This Book

*For Beginners*: Read chapters 1-6 in order. These cover the essentials. Practice the exercises. Build muscle memory before moving forward.

*For Intermediate Users*: Skim the early chapters, focus on chapters 7-10 to deepen your knowledge of metadata, agendas, and capture workflows.

*For Advanced Users*: Jump directly to chapters 11-13 for literate programming, publishing, and advanced techniques.

*As Reference*: Each chapter stands alone. Come back when you need to learn a specific feature.

* Conventions

Throughout this book:

- *Keybindings* are shown as =C-c C-t= (Control-c Control-t) or =M-RET= (Alt-Enter)
- *Code blocks* show org syntax and configuration examples
- *Exercises* at the end of chapters provide hands-on practice
- *Commentary* explains the "why" behind features, not just the "how"

* Acknowledgments

This book stands on the shoulders of giants:

- *Carsten Dominik* for creating Org-Mode
- *Bastien Guerry* and the current Org-Mode maintainers
- The *Org-Mode community* for countless improvements and innovations
- *Richard Stallman* for GNU Emacs, which makes Org-Mode possible

* Begin Your Journey

Org-Mode has a learning curve. That's not a warning—it's a promise. Tools that do everything for everyone do nothing particularly well. Org-Mode provides powerful primitives and trusts you to compose them.

Your first week will feel awkward. Your first month will feel productive. Your first year will make you wonder how you ever managed without it.
